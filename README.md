# Employee Payroll Tracker

## Description
An employee payroll tracker that enables payroll managers to view and manage employee payroll data. It's important keeping track of employee data. Since, it's the way a company's HR department can efficiently handle the human capital of the organization. By building this feature, I learned how important details are in the process of creating an application.

For the employee payroll tracker to work you must:

1. click the "Add employee" button, then you will be presented with a series of prompts asking for number of employees, first name, last name, and salary.
2. Add employee data (number of employees, name, last name, salary).
3. Employee/s will then be displayed on the page sorted alphabetically by last name, and the console will show computed and aggregated data.
